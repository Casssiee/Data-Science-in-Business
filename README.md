# Data-Science-in-Business
------------
## A group of coffee-loving University of Sydney alumni had the business idea of setting up a cafe on University of Sydney campus that only opens at night. To test their business plan and attract potential investors, they opened a pop-up store next to the Fisher Library during the second semester of 2019. The trading hours of the pop-up store is between 7pm and 1am for 7 days a week. They named the shop 'Café Insomnia'.

## Individual transaction records of the pop-up store are collected from 2019 July 22 to 2019 December 22. In addition to collecting purchase related information, each customer was asked to select where on campus she/he was studying and whether it is raining (via an iPad at the cashier's counter). The founders of Café Insomnia are interested in knowing what affects their coffee sales on an hourly basis.

## You are hired as a data analytics professional to address two key questions:

## 1. What affects Café Insomnia’s hourly sales (in AUD)?
-----------
## To answer this question, you should provide a cohesive EDA that combines and extends your individual analyses. You may use any combination of EDA techniques and traditional statistical testing. This might include non-graphical or graphical EDA, clustering or preliminary statistical testing. You must provide accompanying written explanations of your intentions and subsequent findings. Finally you should provide a summary statement.

## It is up to you how you choose to answer this question. You will be assessed on the depth, quality of written analysis/justification and the clarity/presentation of results.

## We have not covered how to do statistical testing in tutorials. However, we have equipped you with the skills and knowledge to research this on your own should you feel the need to take this approach.
---------
## 2.Can a model be built to predict hourly sales (in AUD)?
----------
## This question will require you to carefully consider the goal of the problem and the available data.You must provide a description of how one could build a model to answer question 2 including:

### technical explanation of the model
### discussion of how such a model could be evaluated
### a thorough discussion of assumptions and shortcomings of said model
### a discussion of how to interpret the model generally and an example interpretation of the prototype model
## It is expected that you will have to make simplifications or assumptions to make the model work. It is important that you clearly explain your steps and provide justification for your work.

## You must include a proof of concept in your Jupyter Notebook. The prototype only needs to be a close facsimile of the model you describe in your report that implements the core components. In your report you may describe more advanced techniques which could be incorporated later.
